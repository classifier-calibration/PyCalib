Installation
============

There are multiple ways to install PyCalib. The simplest way is to use the
packaged version available in the Python Package Index PyPI. Further details of
the packaged version can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pycalib/

In order to install PyCalib from PyPI just run the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pycalib

This will install the library into your current Python environment. You can
check that the library is available in your environment by running

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import pycalib; print(pycalib.__version__)"

which if successful should print the installed version in the standard output.
