PyCalib
=======
Python library for classifier calibration

User installation
-----------------

The PyCalib package can be installed from Pypi with the command

```
pip install pycalib
```

Documentation
-------------

The documentation can be found at https://classifier-calibration.github.io/PyCalib/

Development
===========

There is a make file to automate some of the common tasks during development.
After downloading the repository create the virtual environment with the
command

```
make venv
```

This will create a `venv` folder in your current folder. The environment needs
to be loaded out of the makefile with

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

After the environment is loaded, all dependencies can be installed with

```
make requirements-dev
```

Unittest
--------

Unittests are specified as doctest examples in simple functions (see example ),
and more complex tests in their own python files starting with `test_` (see
example ).

Run the unittest with the command

```
make test
```

The test will show a unittest result including the coverage of the code.
Ideally we want to increase the coverage to cover most of the library.

Contiunous Integration
----------------------

Every time a commit is pushed to the master branch a unittest is run following
the workflow [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml). The CI badge
in the README file will show if the test has passed or not.

Analyse code
------------

We are trying to follow the same code standards as in [Numpy][numpy:c] and 
[Scikit-learn][sklearn:c], it is possible to check for pep8 and other code
conventions with

[numpy:c]: https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html
[sklearn:c]: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html

```
make code-analysis
```

Documentation
-------------

The documentation can be found at
[https://www.classifier-calibration.com/PyCalib/](https://www.classifier-calibration.com/PyCalib/),
and it is automatically updated after every push to the master branch.

All documentation is done ussing the [Sphinx documentation
generator][sphinx:l].  The documentation is written in
[reStructuredText][rst:l] (\*.rst) files in the `docs/source` folder. We try to
follow the conventions from [Numpy][numpy:d] and [Scikit-learn][sklearn:d].

[numpy:d]: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html
[sklearn:d]: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#documentation

The examples with images in folder `docs/source/examples` are generated
automatically with [Sphinx-gallery][sphinx:g] from the python code in folder
[examples/](examples/) starting with `xmpl_{example_name}.py`.

[rst:l]: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html
[sphinx:l]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
[sphinx:g]: https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html

The docuemnation can be build with the command

```
make doc
```

(Keep in mind that the documentation has its own Makefile inside folder [docs](docs)).

After building the documentation, a new folder should appear in `docs/build/`
with an `index.html` that can be opened locally for further exploration.

The documentation is always build and deployed every time a new commit is
pushed to the master branch with the workflow
[.github/workflows/documentation.yml](.github/workflows/documentation.yml).

After building, the `docs/build/html` folder is pushed to the branch
[gh-pages][gh:l].

[gh:l]: https://github.com/perellonieto/PyCalib/tree/gh-pages

Check Readme
------------

It is possible to check that the README file passes some tests for Pypi by
running

```
make check-readme
```

Upload to PyPi
--------------

After testing that the code passes all unittests and upgrading the version in
the file `pycalib/__init__.py` the code can be published in Pypi with the
following command:

```
make pypi
```

It may require user and password if these are not set in your home directory a
file  __.pypirc__

```
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-yourtoken
```
